# DemoWebPages
<br>DemoWebPages is a very simply and compact web with 3 pages, which includes Login, Register and Menu. It helps me review how to write a web and how to use HTML, which I have learned in the class. Although it is a small and incompleted web, I do consider the color and layout of it carfully. Therefore, it may be a good example to learn how to construct a web at the very beginning. I welcome everyone to downloan for playing, learning or adding something new to it. Please put a \:star: on my project. :blush:
